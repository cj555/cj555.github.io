## My Starting point

I'm born in China and got my B.S degree in Nanjing University. Then I got my P.D. in Physics in National University of Singapore. My PhD study is about Bio-mimic Nano Machines. I have published two papers on Journel about it. After Ph.D. study, I resumed my study as a Research Fellow in NUS. I love singapore although sometimes a little bit hot. 


## My Current Status

### 	Work

I'm current working as a data analyst in InfoTrie, a news sentiment company. I have done a few projects here, most are about news analytics. We are trying to extract the insight from a large pile of news as fast as possible. 


### Study 	

I want to be a lifelong learner. I believe that
