## My Starting point

I'm born in China and got my B.S degree in Nanjing University. Then I got my P.D. in Physics in National University of Singapore. My PhD study is about Bio-mimic Nano Machines. I have published two papers on Journel about it. After Ph.D. study, I resumed my study as a Research Fellow in NUS. I love singapore although it's a little bit hot here. 


## My Current Status

- Work

I'm current working as a data analyst in InfoTrie, a news sentiment company. I have done a few projects here, most of them are about news analytics. While, seems not related to my previous experiences.

## My Goal 


blablabal


I think I need a page of about me. 




I taught myself how to program when I was ten. Since I had no introduction but only a reference manual, I thought about what could be a useful command, how I would call it in my mother language, translate it into English and then search the reference for it. Thus, I learned how to construct a programming language and how it could be improved.

I have a Masters in Solid State Physics, a Ph.D. in Particle Physics and a Masters in Economics. I lived in Aachen (RWTH), Madrid (Autonoma), Paris (CNRS), Hamburg (DESY), Bologna (INFN), Tokyo (Tokyo Institute of Technology), Palo Alto (SLAC), Geneva (CERN), and ZÃ¼rich. I like traveling, have been to over 60 countries, speak five languages and love outdoor sports.

I worked as a researcher at CERN, Stanford University and in the financial industry (high-frequency prop trading). When I am not doing analysis of some kind, my favorite activity is touring through the Alps with friends, on a Mountainbike in the summer and a Splitboard in the winter.
